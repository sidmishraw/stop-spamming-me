# This is where you write all your regexes for email addresses to dump into JUNK!.
# Comments for this file begin with the `#` symbol.
#
# Valid email addresses's have the following specifications:
# source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Syntax
#
# syntax: `local-part@domain`
#
# Local-part:
# The local-part of the email address may use any of these ASCII characters:
# * uppercase and lowercase Latin letters A to Z and a to z;
# * digits 0 to 9;
# * special characters !#$%&'*+-/=?^_`{|}~;
# * dot ., provided that it is not the first or last character unless quoted, 
#   and provided also that it does not appear 
#   consecutively unless quoted (e.g. John..Doe@example.com is not allowed 
#   but "John..Doe"@example.com is allowed);
# * space and "(),:;<>@[\] characters are allowed with 
#   restrictions (they are only allowed inside a quoted string, as described 
#   in the paragraph below, and in addition, a backslash or double-quote must be preceded by a backslash);
# * comments are allowed with parentheses at either end of the local-part; 
#   e.g. john.smith(comment)@example.com and (comment)john.smith@example.com are both 
#   equivalent to john.smith@example.com.
#
# Domain:
# * uppercase and lowercase Latin letters A to Z and a to z;
# * digits 0 to 9, provided that top-level domain names are not all-numeric;
# * hyphen -, provided that it is not the first or last character.
